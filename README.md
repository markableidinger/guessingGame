 The guessing game for Codefellows Foundations Bootcamp day 1.

I have 3 games in this repository, with the intention of hopefully making it so all 3 can be run from one program once I figure out how to do that.


First, I decided to do the classic "guess a number between 1 and 100" guessing game. The game allows 7 guesses for the user, and notifies the user if their guess is too high or too low. The game ends when the user either guesses correctly or runs out of guesses before they answer correctly. The user is notified of the outcome, and the program ends.

Second, I decided to try to recreate one of the puzzles from my favorite childhood game: The Logical Journey of the Zoombinis. In this game, the player is given a list of pizza toppings, and they are asked to guess a random set of pizza toppings in a certain amount of tries. The game gives feedback based on if there is a topping wrong, and if there are no wrong toppings it will tell them if there are missing toppings. When the correct set is guessed or the user runs out of guesses, they are notified of the outcome and the program ends.

Finaly, I made a dice game in which the player is asked to guess a number that will be rolled on a simulated roll of 2 dice. They are then asked to bet an amount of money out of their remaining money, which starts at 100. If they guess correctly, they will recieve a payout based on the odds of rolling that number. If the player runs out of money, they are notified and the game ends.
